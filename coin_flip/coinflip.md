###The Ultimate Life Decider
Never make a decision again!

####Part One - The Coin of Inevitability

---

1. Create a file called ```decider.js```
2. Write a function called ```coinFlip``` that 'console.logs' ```HEADS``` or ```TAILS``` when called
3. Add a counter that declares ```WINNER``` in the console when either HEADS or TAILS is flipped 5 times.

#####Part Two - The Coin App

---

1. Create a file called ```decider.html```
2. Find any coin image online
3. Link the ```.js``` file, while you're there you may also decide to add a ```.css``` file for some styling
4. Now add the necessary components to the ```decider.html``` file so that when the coin image is clicked the ```coinFlip``` function result and tally are returned somewhere on the page.
