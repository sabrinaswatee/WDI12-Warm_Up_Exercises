# The Board

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using new- line characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
```
# # # # # # # #
 # # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
 # # # # # # # #
```
_bonus_ When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height. Then, define a variable 'symbol' that generates the board using the specified character instead.
