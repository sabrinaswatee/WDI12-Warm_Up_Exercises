# Starbucks

Write a program that holds on to coffee orders.

```
c1 = Coffee.new('latte','2 sugars','medium','Darryl')

```

Write the `.to_s` method for this class so when you `puts c1` you will have "Darryl's latte, medium, 2 sugars."

# Extension

1. Starbucks always gets names wrong, however. Make the name a bad misspelling of the actual name when you create the order.

```
puts c1
# => "Barrel's latte, medium, 2 sugars."
```

2. When you make a new order, you have to wait for coffee. When you create the new order, there should be a waiting time of anywhere between 2-5 minutes. You should be able to check if it's ready by calling `c1.ready?` and have the program yell out the order and the misspelled name.

3. You should be able to mark the coffee as collected with `c1.collected = true`.

4. List all of the coffees not collected.

5. Add options to the coffee order, eg shot of hazelnut, whipped cream, chocolate syrup.
