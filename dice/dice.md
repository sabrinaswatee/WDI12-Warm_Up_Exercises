# Dice

Write a program using classes to generate a standard dice roll.

```
Dice.roll
# => 6
```
It should give you a different result each time.
```
Dice.roll
# => 5
Dice.roll
# => 2
```

When you pass in a number, it rolls the dice that many times, and returns you the array of rolled dice
```
Dice.roll(3)
# => [2,5,1]
```

## Extension

1. Write a method called sum you can chain directly after `Dice.roll(n)`, and will return you the dice and the total, like so:

```
Dice.roll(5).sum
# => [[6,6,5,5], 22]
```

At first you will get a `NoMethodError` for *a certain ruby class*.

How do you fix this?

Why do you get a NoMethodError on that class instead of the class you wrote?


2. Display die faces after rolling.
